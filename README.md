# Project Apollo

Project Apollo is the new field service manager that Flagship group is developing, built from the old project Gabriel that is currently being used in live production, a modern project is born, using the logic and robustness from Gabriel but bringing the technology forwards light-years ahead of the old solution. 

## About

The current solution for flagships repairs system is based from an old legacy system called Gabriel, This system was developed in VB.net and has had many developers over time building upon it, the system is using old/outdated practises, written in a language that isnâ€™t widely used any more. 
As Gabriel in its current form works, and supports over 400 users over 3 companies, it is robust and well tested, however cracks have been showing for a while, and the scalability is hindered by the current architecture, creating a new project from scratch is a massive undertaking so it was decided the best option was to take the logic and robust-ness from Gabriel and LAUNCH it into the 21st century, working with new technologies, practises and a new team, making sure this product will be Out Of This World, Aiming for the Moon, and delivering a solution that does what Gabriel does, with more features to help users and the companies alike.
